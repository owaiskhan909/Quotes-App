## 🌟 Why I Made This

As a beginner in mobile app development, I wanted to start small but meaningful. This project helped me understand:
- How React Native works
- How to use Expo
- Basic animation with the `Animated` API
- Using `useState` and `useRef` hooks
- Styling and layouts in React Native

It may be simple, but it means a lot to me as my **first step** into mobile app development. 🚀
